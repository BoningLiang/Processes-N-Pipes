Requirments {
	
Design a program using ordinary pipes in which one process sends 
a string message to a second process, and the second process reverses 
the case of each character (lower to upper, upper to lower) in the
received message, and sends the reverse-case message to the 
first process. For example, if the first process sends the 
message “Hi There” the second process will reply it with 
“hI tHERE”. The program requires using two pipes: 
one for sending the original message from Process 1 to Process 2,
and the other for sending the reverse-case message from Process 2 to Process 1.
